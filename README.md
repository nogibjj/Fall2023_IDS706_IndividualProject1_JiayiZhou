## Fall2023_IDS706 Individual Project 1

### Purpose
This is for class data engineering individual project 1. It uses a Python Ruff GitHub template with pandas to run and test a function that provides summary statistics and data visualization for a data frame. It utilizes continuous integration using GitHub Actions.

### Steps
I created the template based on the template created by Professor Noah Gift and modified the template. Based on the template from professor, I made the following changes:
1. Added pandas in requirements.txt
2. Modified makefile to add jupyter notebook test.
3. Added functions in lib.py to read the CSV file, store and return the summary statistics table, create and save a plot with Pandas library.
4. Added the function in main.py to call functions in lib.py to read in dataset, store and return the summary statistics table, create and save a plot with Pandas library.
5. Added the function in jupyter notebook to call functions in lib.py to read in dataset, store and return the summary statistics table, create and save a plot with Pandas library.
6. Added test cases in test_lib.py
7. Added test cases in test_main.py

### Dataset
The dataset is loaded in by url.  Here is the url: [(https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/goose/goose_rawdata.csv)](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fivethirtyeight/data/master/goose/goose_rawdata.csv). The file is a comma-separated value spreadsheet (CSV) called goose_rawdata.csv.

### Check format and test errors:
In codespace, I run command make test, make format, and make lint. The commands run smoothly.
